For Step 2.2
1. The "size" of this relationship is equal to the coeffiecnt of the maternal age which is 0.3776. This means that on average the number of maternal de novo mutations increases by 0.3776 for each year older the mother is. Yes, this seems to follow the same trend I saw from the scatter plot.
2. Yes the relationship is significant, I know this from the Prob (F-statistic) which is 6.88e-24. 
For Step 2.3
1. The "size" of this relationship is equal to the coeffiecnt of the paternal age which is equal to 1.3538. This means that on average the number of paternal de novo mutations increases by 1.3538 for each year older the father is. Yes, this seems to follow the same trend I saw from the scatter plot.
2. Yes the relationship is significant, I know this from the Prob (F-statistic) which is 1.55e-84.
For Step 2.4
	y = mx + b
	m = 1.3538 (coef of Father age)
	b = 10.3263 (intercept) 
	y = paternal de novo mutations inherited
	x = father age
	when x = 50.5
	y = (1.3538)(50.5) + 10.3263 = 78.6932
	So we predict that the proband will have ~ 78.6932 mutations based on our model
For Step 2.6
1. I chose an independent t-test, this will tell me the probability of the difference between the mean maternal mut and mean paternal mut being due to random chance.
2. The p-value for the test was 2.198603179308129e-264 which tells us that the difference between the means is statistically significant. The statistic was equal to -53.4 which tells me that on average each proband has 53.4 fewer maternal mutations than paternal mutations.
