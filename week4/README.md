For Step 2
	For sample 1 4 of the 5 peaks were conserved
	For sample 2 all 3 peaks were conserved
	It appears that two of the sample 1 peaks were combined into a single peak

For Step 3
	The peaks called are decently reproducable in each sample.
	No, the p-value only tells you the chance of getting that many reads by random chance. A peak that appears from some techical issue in the assay might have an extreme p-value but it might never show up in subsequent repeats of that assay.
	No, the p-value range of a peak would not be completely consistent.
