For Step 2
	For sample 1 all but 17 of the 120 peaks were conserved 
	For sample 2 all but 12 of the 125 peaks were conserved
	It appears that a few of the lower confidence peaks were dropped and some close peaks were combined.

For Step 3
	The peaks called are decently reproducible in each sample.
	No, the p-value only tells you the chance of getting that many reads by random chance. A peak that appears from some technical issue in the assay might have an extreme p-value but it might never show up in subsequent repeats of that assay.
	No, the p-value range of a peak would not be completely consistent.
