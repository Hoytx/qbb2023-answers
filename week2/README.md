For Step 1.1
1. Take your genome length, multiply by the coverage ammount you want, and divide by the read size.
	So for 3x coverage for a 1Mbp genome with 100 bp sized reads : (1,000,000 x 3)/100 = 300,000 reads to get 3x coverage
For Step 1.3
1. In my simulation 50103 bases were not sequenced, this is 5.0103% of the genome.
2. The poisson expectation fits the simulation quite well, while the normal distribution does not fit the data nearly as well.
For Step 1.4
1. In my simulation 59 bases were not sequenced, this is 0.0059% of the genome.
2. The poisson expectation continues to fit the simulated data quite well. The normal distribution is now much closer to the data but is still a poor predictor.
For Step 1.5
1. In my simulation 10 bases were not sequenced, this is 0.001% of the genome.
2. The poisson expectation is still a good predictor of the simulated data. The normal distribution is now fits the data decently well.
For Step 2.4
The command I used was:
dot -Tpng > ex2_diagraph.png dots.dot

For Step 2.5
One possible sequence is: TTCTTATTCATTGATTGATTT
For Step 2.6
To generate a genome sequence with no ambiguity you would need to be able to generate a De Bruijn graph with no loops. 
For Step 3.1
I used Bard

My prompt was:
Write me a short essay on why someone might be interested in genomics, include citations.

The output:
Why someone might be interested in genomics

Genomics is the study of the genome, which is the complete set of genetic material in an organism. It includes all of the DNA that is found in the chromosomes of the nucleus, as well as the DNA that is found in the mitochondria. Genomics is a rapidly developing field, and it has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of human health and disease.

There are many reasons why someone might be interested in genomics. Here are a few:

    To learn more about their own health and ancestry. Genomics can be used to identify genetic variants that are associated with an increased risk of developing certain diseases. It can also be used to trace ancestry and learn about one's genetic heritage.
    To contribute to research. By participating in genomics research studies, individuals can help scientists to better understand the human genome and its role in health and disease. This research could lead to the development of new diagnostic tests and treatments for a variety of conditions.
    To pursue a career in genomics. Genomics is a growing field with many opportunities for employment. Genomicists work in a variety of settings, including academia, industry, and government. They are involved in a wide range of activities, such as conducting research, developing new technologies, and providing genetic counseling.

Here are some specific examples of how genomics is being used today:

    Genomics is being used to develop new diagnostic tests and treatments for cancer. For example, genomic testing can be used to identify the specific type of cancer that a patient has, as well as the genetic mutations that are driving the cancer. This information can be used to develop personalized treatment plans that are more likely to be effective.
    Genomics is being used to improve the accuracy of prenatal testing. Prenatal testing is used to screen for genetic disorders in unborn babies. Genomic testing can be used to identify a wider range of genetic disorders than traditional prenatal testing methods. This can help parents to make informed decisions about their pregnancy.
    Genomics is being used to develop new treatments for other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Alzheimer's disease. As our understanding of the human genome grows, scientists are developing new ways to target genetic mutations and treat diseases at the source.

Overall, genomics is a rapidly developing field with the potential to have a major impact on human health and disease. There are many reasons why someone might be interested in genomics, including learning more about their own health, contributing to research, and pursuing a career in this field.

For Step 3.2
The output does make logical sense to me. It seems to cover the surface level ideas of why genomics is important and why someone might want to pursue a career in studying genomics. Personally I wouldn't have used so many superfluous statements like "rapidly developing field" or "revolutionize our understanding" and would rather just give more concrete examples.
While I asked for citations and it did provide something, the citations it gave are partially incorrect. The provided links contain the majority of the information you would need to write this but the attributions are messed up. The first citation is attributed to NHGRI but the link doesn't match. The linked wiki atricle doesn't have any source called "genomics" by John Hopkins Medicine.
