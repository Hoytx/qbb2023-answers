For the first graph of exercise 3 we changed the starting population size. The graph shows a trend where the average generations to fixation increases as the population size increases. This is because the random change in allele frequencies per generation is generally quite small. So the larger the population size the longer it will take the random increase/decrease of allele frequencies to reach fixation. Biologically this means that the smaller a population the faster a new allele will either spread to the entire population or die out.

The second graph for exercise 3 shows the effect of changing the starting allele frequencies. The trend shows that the further from 50% the starting frequency is the shorter the average time to fixation is. Biologically this means that without a selection pressure to keep a new allele most new alleles will simply die out, overcoming this hurtle is very unlikely if a mutant allele is selection neutral.

One of the assumptions of the Wright-Fisher model is that there is no selection for or against alleles. If this assumption was not true we would expect the average time to fixation to be decreased. If an allele provides an advantage to survival or mating success then it would be selected for and would be more likely to reach 100% frequency. Conversely if the allele provides a disadvantage then we would expect it to be more likely to die out, although it may persist for a long time. In nature many mutations are silent and as such the varient allele is not selected for or against. However, some do confer an advantage and will lead to that allele becoming dominant in a population.
